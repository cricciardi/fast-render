It is a gaseous cyan-coloured ice giant. Most of the planet is made of water, ammonia, and methane in a supercritical phase of matter, which astronomy calls "ice" or volatiles. The planet's atmosphere has a complex layered cloud structure and has the lowest minimum temperature (49 K (\u2212224 \xB0C; \u2212371 \xB0F)) of all the Solar System's planets. It has a marked axial tilt of 82.23\xB0 with a retrograde rotation period of 17 hours and 14 minutes. This means that in an 84-Earth-year orbital period around the Sun, its poles get around 42 years of continuous sunlight, followed by 42 years of continuous darkness. `),n(),d(4,"app-list-images",2)),t&2&&(a(),f(i.Planets.URANUS),a(3),u("nasaApi$",i.nasaApi$))},dependencies:[v],encapsulation:2})};export{S as UranusImagesComponent};
